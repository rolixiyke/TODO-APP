# Todo Application

## Project Overview
This is a simple Todo application built with **Node.js**, **MongoDB**, and **EJS**. It allows users to create, manage, and organize their tasks with three possible states: **pending**, **completed**, and **deleted**. The application includes authentication to ensure that each user only sees their own tasks.

### Features:
- **User Authentication**: Users can sign up, log in, and log out to manage their own tasks.
- **Task Management**: Users can create tasks, mark them as completed, or delete them.
- **Task Sorting**: Users can sort tasks between **pending** and **completed**.
- **Simple UI**: The application has a clean and easy-to-use interface.

## ERD (Entity-Relationship Diagram)
This project uses the following database schema to represent the relationships between users and tasks.

### Database Schema:
1. **User**
   - `username` (String)
   - `passwordHash` (String)

2. **Task**
   - `description` (String)
   - `state` (String: "pending", "completed", "deleted")
   - `userId` (ObjectId: references the User model)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites:
- **Node.js**: Make sure Node.js is installed on your system.
- **MongoDB**: Either run MongoDB locally or use [MongoDB Atlas](https://www.mongodb.com/cloud/atlas) for a cloud-based solution.

### Installation:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-app.git
   cd todo-app
2.	Install dependencies:
3.	npm install
4.	Set up the MongoDB database:
o	If using MongoDB locally, make sure the MongoDB server is running. You can start MongoDB with: 
o	mongod
o	If using MongoDB Atlas, update the mongoose.connect() URI in the app.js file with your MongoDB connection string.
Environment Variables:
Make sure to set up your environment variables for the session and MongoDB connection string. You can create a .env file to store them:
MONGODB_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/todoapp
SESSION_SECRET=your-secret-key
Running the Application:
1.	Start the application:
2.	node app.js
3.	Visit http://localhost:3000 in your browser to view the application.
Routes:
•	GET /: Displays the list of tasks for the logged-in user.
•	GET /signup: Displays the signup page.
•	POST /signup: Registers a new user.
•	GET /login: Displays the login page.
•	POST /login: Authenticates a user.
•	POST /add-task: Adds a new task.
•	POST /update-task/:id: Updates the state of a task (e.g., mark as completed).
•	POST /delete-task/:id: Deletes a task.
•	GET /logout: Logs the user out.
